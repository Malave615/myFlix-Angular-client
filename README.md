# MyFlix-Angular-Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16. Angular was used to create a single-page, responsive movie app with routing and several interface views. The client-side developed in this Achievement will support the existing server-side architecture, REST API and database, by facilitating user requests and rendering the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views. The app will be accompanied by relevant documentation and handoff deliverables, including a kanban board containing user stories and story points.

## Project Overview

This is the front-end application for a movie database movie_api I previously built. It allows users to browse a collection of movies, view detailed information about each movie, director, genre, and starring actors. Users can create and manage an account including adding a list of their favorite movies.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
